# Legendary Pokémon Analysis: Data Science & Power BI Dashboard 🐉📊

## Overview 🚀

This project offers a comprehensive data science exploration and interactive visualization of Pokémon statistics using real-world data. Combining Python-based analysis (via Jupyter Notebook in VS Code) and a visually rich Power BI dashboard, it demonstrates advanced analytics, interactive storytelling, and best practices in end-to-end data projects.

## Contents 📁

- `Project_Code.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with all analysis, data cleaning, modeling, and visualizations.
- `Pokemon.csv` — Cleaned Pokémon dataset used in both analyses.
- `Dashboard-Image.jpg` — Power BI dashboard image for quick preview.
- *(Optional: Power BI `.pbix` file for hands-on dashboard exploration.)*

## Problem Statement ❓

The aim is to analyze the determinants of legendary Pokémon, find patterns among generations and types, and present actionable insights for both data science and business intelligence audiences.

## Data Science Workflow (VS Code & Jupyter) 🐍📈

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and encoded categorical and missing values in Pokémon data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Used Python libraries to explore types, stats, and legendary distribution.
- **Feature Engineering & Modeling:** Built machine learning models (Random Forest) to predict legendary status.
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using classification metrics and feature importance.
- **Insights:** Identified which attributes contribute most to making a Pokémon 'Legendary'.

## Power BI Dashboard Highlights 🎨📊

- **Title:** Legendary Pokémon Analysis Dashboard
- **Key Features:**
  - Dual attack and defense bar charts showing distribution by legendary Pokémon.
  - Donut chart visualizing the legendary vs. non-legendary split.
  - Overall stats (HP, Speed, Generation, Total) for all Pokémon.
  - Interactive Pokémon selector and engaging design with custom visuals.
  - Fun and professional Pokémon theme for engagement and storytelling.
- **Purpose:** Transform machine learning and statistical insights into interactive, executive-ready visualizations.

## How to Use ▶️

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open `Project_Code.ipynb` in VS Code (with Jupyter extension) or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Install Python requirements as needed (`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`).
   - Run cells for data exploration, modeling, and insights.

2. **Power BI Dashboard:**
   - Open `Dashboard-Image.jpg` for a quick visual summary.
   - (Optional) Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard.

## Results & Insights 📊🔍

- Most legendary Pokémon cluster in specific generations and types.
- Attack and defense stats are major contributors for legendary classification.
- Legends form less than 10% of the total Pokémon, but dominate stat distributions.
